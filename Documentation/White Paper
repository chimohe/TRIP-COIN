$TRIP Coin - Decentralized Payment Solution for Psychedelic Retreats

Abstract:

$TRIP Coin is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to facilitate seamless and secure decentralized payments for psychedelic retreats and related wellness services. By leveraging blockchain technology, $TRIP Coin provides a cost-effective, transparent, and efficient solution for booking, paying, and rewarding travel-related activities in the psychedelic wellness space.

1. Introduction

The psychedelic wellness industry is rapidly growing, with more individuals seeking transformative experiences through guided psychedelic retreats. These retreats, often held in serene and remote locations, offer therapeutic experiences using substances such as psilocybin, ayahuasca, and other plant medicines.

It aims to provide a decentralized, fast, and low-fee alternative to traditional payment systems.
